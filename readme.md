# Wospec Raycaster

___

This was a ray-caster I wrote on one of my few weekends during my specialist training in NS. Hope whoever (most likely me!) that references or wants to look at this project finds it interesting, cool, and/or useful!

I could be using GLM or some other math library that contains vector math, but being in NS has literally degraded my brain to primary school tier math (getting that encik brain bro frfr), so a lot of code here is redundant by todays standards, and serves as a practice after not coding anything Euclidean related.

Getting my 3rd sergeant rank in May 2022, let's see if I finish this little side project by then :)
